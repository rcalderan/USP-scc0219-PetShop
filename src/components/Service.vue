      Prevention is Our Promise
      PetSmart knows prevention is a very powerful thing.
      Through twice-a-year comprehensive veterinary exams and year-round attention, you have a partner in preventive health care. Banfield provides pet health information and pet care tools to help you become the educated and prepared owner that your pet deserves. Together, we can monitor and track over time many of the facets of your pet's wellness: dental care, behavior, parasite control, nutrition, and vaccinations.
      Prevention is about peace of mind â€“ the kind that comes from knowing that you are proactively monitoring the health and wellness of the pets you love. Banfield would love to partner with you in the ongoing care of your pet.
